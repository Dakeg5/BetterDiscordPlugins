# FAQ

### What is this?

A repository for my plugins for BetterDiscord.

Some of the plugins have been ported from Replugged/Powercord.

### How to download a plugin?

Go to Raw Link of the plugin and press **CTRL+S**. Then save it to the plugins folder of BetterDiscord.

### Why aren't all plugins listed in the README file?

They are either beta plugins or plugins which are illegal.

In short: plugins not to be released.

### What about credits?

Many of these plugins are ported from Replugged/Powercord. The original authors of these plugins have been given credits underneath the description of their plugins.

If you've made one of the Replugged/Powercord plugins and have not been given proper credit, then either DM me on Discord or make a pull request.<sup> (Issues work too.)</sup>

### GIF source?

All links are fetched from Tenor using Tenor's API.

### What about licenses?

I don't care. Copy my plugins if you want to.

If the plugin was ported, then ask the original author before doing so.

### Where can I find the support server?

The support server for all the plugins. You can join it here:

[![Support Server](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/919649417005506600/widget.png?style=banner3)](https://discord.gg/SgKSKyh9gY)

# Who is the author of these plugins?

# Why did you start making these plugins?

The reason this repository has started is because of a certain someone. The person saved me from dying. She is the reason I am here today. I loved her so much.

This all started with an NSFW bypass plugin (It's part of DiscordBypasses Plugin now), because my ex filled in her real birth date on Discord and couldn't access channels marked as NSFW.
